# Casio G-Shock Smart Sync

## Announcement
Added [Companion Device Pairing](https://developer.android.com/develop/connectivity/bluetooth/companion-device-pairing) for more reliable Bluetooth connections!

## What is it?
I think we can do better than the official Casio G-Shock App!

Instead of listing all the features, here is what ChatGPT thinks about it:

**G-Shock Smart Sync** is an unofficial, open-source Android app for G-Shock, Edifice, and Pro Trek watches that allows you to control your watch and sync data **without a Casio ID**.

## Supported Watch Models

Works with many **G-Shock**, **Edifice**, and **Pro Trek** variants. Here are the models reported to be compatible with the app and their modules.

> **Note:** By _compatible watches_ we mean that these watches can work with the app, but this does not mean that every function of the watch is supported by the app. For example, fitness functions are not implemented in the app.

The app works by sending commands to the watch via Bluetooth (BLE). The watch data is not persisted on the phone, but instead is read from the watch each time 
a connection is established. Any changes on the app are sent back to the watch, only when the `Send to Watch` button is pressed.  

## Setting Time
<img src="fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/TimeScreen.png"
alt="Time Screen"
width=200
style="margin: 10px;" />

The local time can be set from the main screen by pressing the `Send to Watch` button next to the current time display. The app uses your current location to get the local lime.
You can then set the watch time accordingly, without having to change your `World Time` selection on the watch.

This screen also shows your `Home Time` location and battery level.

## Alarms

<img src="fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/AlarmsScreen.png"
alt="Alarms Screen"
width=200
style="float: left; margin: 10px;" />

<img src="fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/SetAlarmScreen.png"
alt="Set Alarm Screen"
width=200
style="margin: 10px;" />

The B5600/B5000 watches have 5 alarms and a `Signal` or `chime` setting. They are first read from the watch,
and displayed in the app. The alarms can be updated by pressing on the time display of each alarm. 
A dialog will appear which allows you to select the time.

Once the alarms have been set, you can send them to the watch, or send them to the `Alarm Clock` app on the phone. 
Unfortunately, there is currently no way to read the alarms from the `Alarm Clock` app programmatically, 
so we cannot set the watch alarms from this app. However, we can set the `Alarm Clock` app with the watch's alarms.

## Events
<img src="fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/EventsScreen.png"
alt="Events Screen"

style="margin: 10px;" />

>Syncing Your Calendar
Ensure that your phone is set to auto-sync with your Google Account. Without this setting, events added to your phone will not sync with your Google account and will not appear in the app.

# Syncing Your Calendar

Ensure that your phone is set to **auto-sync with your Google Account**. Without this setting, events added to your phone will not sync with your Google account and will not appear in the app.

## About This Screen

This screen displays events from your Google Calendar and allows you to send these events to your watch's reminders. *(Note: These are distinct from reminders in the Google Calendar app. The watch reminders are a unique feature and cannot be accessed programmatically.)*

## Event Types and Compatibility

Google Calendar supports various types of events:

- **One-time events**: Single occurrences.
- **Repeating events**: Daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, or complex patterns (e.g., "every second Thursday of the month").
- **Count events**: Limited repetitions, such as "repeat 12 times every Monday."

While the app does its best to adapt calendar events to the watch, some limitations exist:

- **Not Supported**: Daily events and complex patterns (e.g., "every second Thursday of the month").
- **Count Events**: Simulated on the watch using a start and end date, adjusted to match the event's start time, frequency, and count.

Events that cannot be adapted will appear as **Incompatible**. Only future events and ongoing recurring events are displayed.

## Watch-Specific Behavior

The watch only supports **all-day reminders**. For Google Calendar events with a specific time, the app will convert them into all-day reminders on the watch while still retaining their date.


## Actions
<img src="fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/ActionsScreen.png"
alt="Events Screen"
width=200
style="margin: 10px;" />

The selected actions are run when the user short-presses the lower-right watch button from disconnected mode (initial screen). Using these actions, the watch acts like a remote control for your phone.

## Settings
<img src="fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/Settings.png"
alt="Set Alarm Screen"
width=200
style="margin: 10px;" />

This screen allows you to set up the watch's settings. You can auto prefill the values using information from your phone.

## Where are my World Cities?
Using an app to manually swap between Home Time and World Time is a bit silly. Your phone already knows where you are. 
When setting time, this app will also set the Home Time, Timezone and DST state to your current location. 
So when travelling to another timezone, just set time and you are good to go.

## Build Your Own App
For those who want to build their own Android app for interfacing with the G-Shock 5000/5600 watches, I have also created an API (library) project [here](https://github.com/izivkov/GShockAPI). 

## Similar Project

If you’d prefer not to use a mobile app but still want to set the correct time on your G-Shock, check out [this Python project](https://github.com/izivkov/GShockTimeServer). It can run as a server on a regular PC or Raspberry Pi with a Bluetooth interface. We’ve recently added support for an LCD display on the Pi—take a look!
