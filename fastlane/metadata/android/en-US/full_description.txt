Note: We now support the B2100 series of G-Shock watches!

I think we can do better than the official G-Shock Connected App! This app provides the following extra features:

- Sets watch's reminders from Google Calendar
- Automatically sets correct timezone when travelling. No need to switch between Word Time and Home time
- Use your watch to trigger actions on your phone remotely, like taking pictures, dialling a phone number, etc.
- Auto-configure most watch settings from phone's configuration.
- Phone's alarms can be synced with watch's alarms.
- Super fast connection time: 3.5 seconds vs 12 seconds for the official app.

The supported watches B500, B5600 and B2100 series:

General
=======
The app works by sending commands to the watch via Bluetooth (BLE). The watch 
data is not persisted on the phone, but instead is read from the watch each 
time a connection is established. Any changes on the app are sent back to the 
watch, only when the Send to Watch button is pressed.

Setting Time
============
The local time can be set from the main screen by pressing the Send to Watch 
button next to the current time display. The app uses your current location to 
get the local lime. You can then set the watch time accordingly, without having 
to change your World Time selection on the watch.

This screen also shows your Home Time location and battery level.

Alarms
======
The B5600/B5000/B2100 watches have 5 alarms and a Signal or chime setting. They are first read
from the watch, and displayed in the app. The alarms can be updated by pressing 
on the time display of each alarm. A dialog will appear which allows you to 
select the time.

Once the alarms have been set, you can send them to the watch, or send them to 
the Alarm Clock app on the phone. Unfortunately, there is currently no way to 
read the alarms from the AlarmClock app programmatically, so we cannot set the 
watch alarms from this app. However, we can set the Alarm Clock app with the 
watch's alarms.

Events
======
Make sure you have set your phone to auto-sync to your google account. 
Otherwise, adding events in your phone will not be reflected to the Google 
account, and you will not be able to see the events in the app.

This screen displays Events from your Google Calendar and allows you to send 
these events to the watch's reminders. (don't confuse these with reminders in 
the Google Calendar app. These reminders are special features and are not
accessible programmatically).

There are many ways to set calendar events in Google Calendar. Events could be 
one time, repeating daily, weekly, monthly or yearly, or some complex period 
such as every second Thursday of the month. There are also events which occur 
number of times only (count events), like repeat this event 12 times every 
Monday. Not all event types can be supported on the watch, but this app 
attempts to adopt the calendar events to the watch as much as possible. The 
only not supported event types are daily and complex events, such as every
second Thursday of the month. Count events are simulated on the watch with
a start and end date, matching the event start time, count and frequency.
In case the calendar event cannot be adopted to a watch reminder, the app
will display the event as Incompatible. Only future events and recurring
events which have not expired are displayed.

The watch only supports all-day reminders. However, if the Google calendar 
event has a specific time, it will still be used as a day reminder on the watch.

Actions
=======
The selected actions are run when the user short-presses the lower-right watch 
button from disconnected mode (initial screen).

Using these actions, the watch acts like a remote control for your phone.

Build Your Own App
==================
For those who want to build their own Android app for interfacing with the G-Shock 5000/5600/B2100 watches,
I have also created an API (library) project here: https://github.com/izivkov/GShockAPI.
