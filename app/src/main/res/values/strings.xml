    When setting the time, some watch models may display a time that is slightly off by a few seconds. This setting allows you to fine-tune the time adjustment.
    The value, in milliseconds, is added to the time sent from the app to the watch. You can set values between -5000 and 5000. For example,
    if your watch is 2.5 seconds ahead of the actual time, set this value to -2500 to sync it accurately.
